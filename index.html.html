        <p>Sharks star in blockbuster movies as blood-seeking villains, but in reality they’re far more fascinating and complicated than they’re often depicted in pop culture.</p>

        <p>Based on fossilized teeth and scales, scientists believe that sharks have been around for more than 400 million years—long before the dinosaurs. The ocean’s top predators have evolved into roughly 500 species that come in all different sizes and colors and have varying diets and behavior.</p>

        
       
        <div class="anatomy">
        <a name="Anatomy"></a>
        <h2>Anatomy</h2>


        <p>Like rays and skates, sharks fall into a subclass of fish called <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elasmobranchii">elasmobranchii</a>. Species in this subclass have skeletons made from cartilage, not bone, and have five to seven gill slits on each side of their heads (most other fish have only one gill slit on each side), which they use to filter oxygen from the water.</p>

        <p>Whale sharks, the largest fish species on Earth, can grow to more than 55 feet, while <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwarf_lanternshark">dwarf lantern sharks</a> reach a mere eight inches.</p>

        <p>Formidable predators, sharks have mouths lined with multiple rows of individual teeth that fall out and grow back on a routine basis. Their teeth come in all sizes and shapes, from serrated like a razor to triangular like a spear.</p>
        <ol>
        <h3>Teeth</h3>
        <li>Shark teeth are embedded in the gums rather than directly affixed to the jaw, and are constantly replaced throughout life. Multiple rows of replacement teeth grow in a groove on the inside of the jaw and steadily move forward in comparison to a conveyor belt; some sharks lose 30,000 or more teeth in their lifetime. The rate of tooth replacement varies from once every 8 to 10 days to several months.<img src="https://static-wos.saveourseas.com/2021/06/Shark-Jaw-bone-with-teeth-cshutterstock_139135397.jpg"/> In most species, teeth are replaced one at a time as opposed to the simultaneous replacement of an entire row, which is observed in the <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cookiecutter_shark">cookiecutter shark</a>.

            
        Tooth shape depends on the shark's diet: those that feed on mollusks and crustaceans have dense and flattened teeth used for crushing, those that feed on fish have needle-like teeth for gripping, and those that feed on larger prey such as mammals have pointed lower teeth for gripping and triangular upper teeth with serrated edges for cutting. The teeth of plankton-feeders such as the basking shark are small and non-functional.</li>
        
        <h3>Skeleton</h3>
        <li>Shark skeletons are very different from those of bony fish and terrestrial vertebrates. Sharks and other cartilaginous fish (skates and rays) have skeletons made of cartilage and connective tissue. Cartilage is flexible and durable, yet is about half the normal density of bone. This reduces the skeleton's weight, saving energy. Because sharks do not have rib cages, they can easily be crushed under their own weight on land.</li>

        <h3>Jaw</h3>
        <li>The jaws of sharks, like those of rays and skates, are not attached to the cranium. The jaw's surface (in comparison to the shark's vertebrae and gill arches) needs extra support due to its heavy exposure to physical stress and its need for strength. It has a layer of tiny hexagonal plates called "tesserae", which are crystal blocks of calcium salts arranged as a mosaic. This gives these areas much of the same strength found in the bony tissue found in other animals.

        Generally sharks have only one layer of tesserae, but the jaws of large specimens, such as the bull shark, tiger shark, and the great white shark, have two to three layers or more, depending on body size. The jaws of a large great white shark may have up to five layers. In the rostrum (snout), the cartilage can be spongy and flexible to absorb the power of impacts.</li>

        <h3>Fins</h3>
        <img src="https://i.natgeofe.com/n/7beb7028-c007-40ee-aeff-2e3738ad616c/05-shark-fin-soup-nationalgeographic_2641253.jpg"/>
        <li>Fin skeletons are elongated and supported with soft and unsegmented rays named ceratotrichia, filaments of elastic protein resembling the horny keratin in hair and feathers. Most sharks have eight fins. Sharks can only drift away from objects directly in front of them because their fins do not allow them to move in the tail-first direction.</li>
        


        <h3>Dermal denticles</h3>

        <li>Unlike bony fish, sharks have a complex dermal corset made of flexible collagenous fibers and arranged as a helical network surrounding their body. This works as an outer skeleton, providing attachment for their swimming muscles and thus saving energy. Their dermal teeth give them hydrodynamic advantages as they reduce turbulence when swimming. Some species of shark have pigmented denticles that form complex patterns like spots (e.g. Zebra shark) and stripes (e.g. Tiger shark). These markings are important for camouflage and help sharks blend in with their environment, as well as making them difficult for prey to detect. For some species, dermal patterning returns to healed denticles even after they have been removed by injury.</li>
        
        <h3>Tails</h3>
       
        <img src="https://seaworld.org/-/media/migrated-media/seaworld-dotorg/images/infobooks/sharks-and-rays/section-content/adaptations/pic-07-wild-shark-adaptations.jpg?hash=3C7EB24DB8F453A61E3FD8A4AFEF45838AF8239B&version=1_201812050505"/>
        <li>Tails provide thrust, making speed and acceleration dependent on tail shape. Caudal fin shapes vary considerably between shark species, due to their evolution in separate environments. Sharks possess a heterocercal caudal fin in which the dorsal portion is usually noticeably larger than the ventral portion. This is because the shark's vertebral column extends into that dorsal portion, providing a greater surface area for muscle attachment. This allows more efficient locomotion among these negatively buoyant cartilaginous fish. By contrast, most bony fish possess a homocercal caudal fin.

        Tiger sharks have a large upper lobe, which allows for slow cruising and sudden bursts of speed. The tiger shark must be able to twist and turn in the water easily when hunting to support its varied diet, whereas the porbeagle shark, which hunts schooling fish such as mackerel and herring, has a large lower lobe to help it keep pace with its fast-swimming prey. Other tail adaptations help sharks catch prey more directly, such as the thresher shark's usage of its powerful, elongated upper lobe to stun fish and squid.</li>

        <a name="Behavior"></a>
        <h2>Behavior</h2>

        <p>Sharks are found in deep and shallow waters throughout the world’s oceans, with some migrating vast distances to breed and feed. Some species are solitary, while others hang out in groups to varying degrees.<a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lemon_shark">Lemon sharks</a>, for example, have been found to congregate in groups to socialize.</p>

        <p>Scientists are still trying to figure out how long sharks live and have only studied the ages of a fraction of shark species. Most notable is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenland_shark">Greenland shark</a>, Earth’s longest-lived vertebrate at 272 years.</p>

        <p>Most sharks eat smaller fish and invertebrates, but some of the larger species prey on seals, sea lions, and other marine mammals.</p>

        
        <div class="attack">
        <a name="Attack"></a>
        <h2>Attack</h2>
        
        <p>In 2006 the International Shark Attack File (ISAF) undertook an investigation into 96 alleged shark attacks, confirming 62 of them as unprovoked attacks and 16 as provoked attacks. The average number of fatalities worldwide per year between 2001 and 2006 from unprovoked shark attacks is 4.3.</p>

        <p>Contrary to popular belief, only a few sharks are dangerous to humans. Out of more than 470 species, only four have been involved in a significant number of fatal, unprovoked attacks on humans: the great white, oceanic whitetip, tiger, and bull sharks. These sharks are large, powerful predators, and may sometimes attack and kill people. Despite being responsible for attacks on humans they have all been filmed without using a protective cage.</p>
        <img src="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01778/sharkattack_1778841b.jpg"/>

        <p>The perception of sharks as dangerous animals has been popularized by publicity given to a few isolated unprovoked attacks, such as the Jersey Shore shark attacks of 1916, and through popular fictional works about shark attacks, such as the Jaws film series. Jaws author <a href ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Benchley">Peter Benchley</a>, as well as Jaws director <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Spielberg">Steven Spielberg</a>, later attempted to dispel the image of sharks as man-eating monsters.</p>

        <p>To help avoid an unprovoked attack, humans should not wear jewelry or metal that is shiny and refrain from splashing around too much.</p>

        <p>In general, sharks show little pattern of attacking humans specifically, part of the reason could be that sharks prefer the blood of fish and other common preys. Research indicates that when humans do become the object of a shark attack, it is possible that the shark has mistaken the human for species that are its normal prey, such as seals. This was further proven in a recent study conducted by researchers at the California State University's Shark Lab. According to footage caught by the Lab's drones, juveniles swam right up to humans in the water without any bites incidents. The lab stated that the results showed that humans and sharks can co-exist in the water.</p>

        <a name="Sleep"></a>
        <h2>Sleep</h2>
        <p>All sharks need to keep water flowing over their gills in order for them to breathe; however, not all species need to be moving to do this. Those that are able to breathe while not swimming do so by using their spiracles to force water over their gills, thereby allowing them to extract oxygen from the water. It has been recorded that their eyes remain open while in this state and actively follow the movements of divers swimming around them and as such they are not truly asleep.</p>

        <p>Species that do need to swim continuously to breathe go through a process known as sleep swimming, in which the shark is essentially unconscious. It is known from experiments conducted on the <a href ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiny_dogfish">spiny dogfish</a> that its spinal cord, rather than its brain, coordinates swimming, so spiny dogfish can continue to swim while sleeping, and this also may be the case in larger shark species. In 2016 a great white shark was captured on video for the first time in a state researchers believed was sleep swimming.</p>

        <a name="Threats"></a>
        <h2>Threats</h2>
        <div class="Threats">
        <img src="https://www.oceans-research.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Diet-and-Predators.jpg"/>
        <p>Sharks may not be a significant threat to us, but we are to them. Humans are responsible for drastic declines in shark populations.</p>

        <p>Overfishing is the biggest threat. An estimated 100 million sharks are killed each year, mostly to supply demand for an expensive Chinese dish called <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shark_fin_soup">shark fin soup</a>. Some fisheries allow the catch of whole sharks, like any other fish, while others have outright banned shark fishing. Sometimes fishermen cut the fins off live sharks and dump the animals, finless, back into the ocean, where they’ll drown or bleed out. This practice is called shark finning, and it’s done to save space on the boat (the fins are the most valuable part of a shark) and to avoid surpassing fishing quotas.</p>

        <p>Rising water temperatures and coastal development are also contributing to shrinking populations by destroying the mangroves and coral reefs that sharks use for breeding, hunting, and protecting young shark pups.</p>

        <p>A drop in numbers is bad news for sharks but also for ocean health in general: As top predators of the ocean, sharks are critical for ensuring a balanced food web.</p>
